# Durandal typeahead.js Binding Handler

Knockout binding handler for the Twitter typeahead.js and Bloodhound jQuery plugins written in TypeScript. This binding handler is made to be used in conjunction with the Durandal SPA application framework. Since the Durandal framework is no longer being actively developed and has been superseded by Aurelia, this project is also no longer active.
